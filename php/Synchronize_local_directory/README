This is a beta version!!!

- When the plugin needs to create severall 1000 new thumbnails, it can happen, that it time outs.
Just execute it again. It won't recreate thumbnails which already exist.

- It doesn't create thumbnails of movies yet. Actually that's a bit complicated to to, since piwigo (for what ever reason) expects movies not to be in the pwg_high dir, but in the websized dir.

- adjust in synchronlizeLocaldirectory.php the variables "sync_source_dir" and "piwigo_gallery_dir"
